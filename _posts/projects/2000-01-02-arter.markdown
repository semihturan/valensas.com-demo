An initiative of the Vehbi Koç Foundation (VKF), Arter opened in 2010 to offer a sustainable infrastructure for producing and exhibiting contemporary art. Situated on Istiklal Street, Istanbul’s main artery for culture and arts, Arter has been presenting solo and group exhibitions by artists from Turkey and abroad. Arter’s programme also features publications that accompany each exhibition.

<b>What can I do with the Arter iOS app?</b>

Explore Arter’s exhibitions; find your way around the exhibition space using iBeacon technology; access additional visual and textual content about the works; and listen to, or watch the stories behind their production in the artists’ own words. View past exhibitions; keep track of events such as artists’ talks, performances, and exhibition tours; and find out more about Arter’s publications.
