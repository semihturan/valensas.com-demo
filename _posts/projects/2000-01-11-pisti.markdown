Sometimes we need a little fun distraction in life to get our mind off of things. PISTI is a neat card game that can be played either online with multiple players or offline against the iPhone. Included is a Voice Chat feature with other players -can be turned on or off during game- and the capability of viewing the players’ location and identifies if they are using an iPhone or iPad. With the Game Center integration it’s more fun by inviting friends for a little competition..
