Skylife, Turkish Airlines’ in-flight magazine, has added value and color to the journeys of people traveling to various locations in Turkey and worldwide for more than twenty-seven years.

Based on a foundation of travel, culture, and arts, Skylife also covers a wide range of other subjects, from technology to arts and from hobbies to lifestyle and health, all inseparable parts of the magazine’s unique, value-added content.

With the September 2009 issue, you were presented with a Skylife brand new in terms of content and design. Now, with the Skylife iPad app, you will be able to access not only all existing content in the magazine, but also expanded, exclusive content and interactive applications, demo tracks of musicians and albums, videos, image galleries, and various animations.
